== Description ==

Add additional featured images to any post type and display using either a built in image gallery/slideshow shortcode or by using a single image shortcode. Most plugins or developers use the non Javasript API media uploader, which is notorious for being glitchy and slow.  This leverages the not well known WordPress Javascript API to mimic the built in media uploader.  Great for end users or developers.
